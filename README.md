# Credit_Card_Transactions_SQL
I conducted an advanced analysis of credit card transactions using complex SQL queries. These queries enabled me to extract valuable insights such as identifying spending patterns, detecting anomalies, and segmenting customers based on transaction behavior. The project demonstrated my proficiency in SQL and ability to derive actionable insights from large-scale transaction data.
